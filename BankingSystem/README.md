# BankingSystem Project

## Overview
This project is a basic banking system application to demonstrate object-oriented design and creational design patterns in Java. We use the Singleton, Factory, and Builder patterns.

### Project Structure
- **client**: Contains the main application entry point.
- **domain**: Holds the core classes (`Account`, `Customer`, `Transaction`, and `Bank`).
- **factory**: Contains the `AccountFactory` for creating different types of accounts.
- **models**: Includes the `TransactionBuilder` class for building complex `Transaction` objects.

### Usage
- Run the `Main` class in the `client` package to execute the sample banking application.

### Requirements
- Java JDK
- Git
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
